# Lujan Rafael Rezende
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

I have been studying  Machine Learning since 2018 in environmental engineering college, in my final paper i used a neural network to detect semantical segmentation of landslides scars.

I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as insights trought data and sales forecast.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.

**Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite. Flask-sqlachemy.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python.

**Development:** Git, Linux, Scrum, Docker, Flask.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series.

**Machine Learning Deployment:** Heroku, Azure.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann - Sales Forescast Project]( https://github.com/lujanrr/lujanrr-rossmann-sales)
Building a Machine Learning Model to sales  is a common and essential use in data science.  

In this project, i developed a Machine Learning model able to forescat sales with **Mean Absolute Percentage error accuracy(MAPE): 0.14 +/- 0.02**.
The performance of this model would increase **revenue of R$5 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### [Health Insurance Cross Sell - Learning to Rank Project]( https://github.com/lujanrr/lujanrr_health_insurance_cross_sell)
Learning to rank (LTR) is a class of algorithmic techniques that apply supervised machine learning to solve ranking problems in search relevancy. In other words, it’s what orders query results.

In this project, i developed a model able to predict the probability of a customer purchasing vehicle insurance . In this way, ranking customers from the most likely to purchase to the least likely.

With 20.000 calls made to a new set of 127.000 customers, the perfomance of this model with **Recall at 20000:  0.81** would increase **annual revenue of R$2.4 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

## Data Analysis - Insight Projets

### [House Rocket - Insights Project]( https://github.com/lujanrr/lujanrr-house-rocket)
Knowing how to analyze and explore data is critical knowledge for a data scientist.

In this project, through exploration, analysis and data visualization tools, I created insights for the company and in the end recommended the purchase of 20 properties resulting in **revenue of R$9 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.



## Data Engineering - ETL Projets
